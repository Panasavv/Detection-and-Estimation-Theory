# Detection and Estimation Theory
Undergraduate Subject in AUTH

In this subject, we had to split into groups of three and then an assignment was given to each group.
Our team had to recreate the "On Autoregressive Order Selection Criteria" paper published in 1 March 
2004 by Venus Khim-Sen Liew.

This project was developed in Matlab R2020a.
